# Battery Management System using STM32

This repository contains the implementation of a Battery Management System (BMS) using the STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) microcontroller. The system monitors battery voltage and current, calculates State of Charge (SOC), and displays real-time values on an OLED display. Audible and visual alerts are triggered during low SOC or abnormal current conditions.

Developed as part of the Experiential Learning Program under the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering.

## Objective

To develop a low-cost and efficient BMS using ARM-based embedded systems capable of:
- Monitoring voltage and current in real-time
- Estimating and displaying battery SOC
- Alerting users during critical battery conditions

## Features

- Real-time ADC-based voltage and current monitoring
- SOC estimation
- OLED display via I2C (SSD1306, 0.96")
- Buzzer alert when SOC < 20% or current spike occurs
- LED indicators for battery status
- Based on STM32F103C8T6 (ARM Cortex-M3)

## Code Snippet

```cpp
float voltage = analogRead(PA0) * (actual_voltage_ratio);
float shunt_voltage = analogRead(PA1) * voltage_per_bit;
float current = shunt_voltage / shunt_resistor_value;

int soc = map(voltage, min_voltage, max_voltage, 0, 100);

if (soc < 20 || current > max_safe_current) {
    digitalWrite(buzzer_pin, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(red_led_pin, HIGH);
} else {
    digitalWrite(buzzer_pin, LOW);
    digitalWrite(green_led_pin, HIGH);
}

```
```
OLED Display Format
